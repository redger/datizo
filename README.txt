DATIZO: DAte TIme ZOne

The Datizo project is made of two parts:

1. "libdtz" is the Datizo library written in the "D programming language".
2. "datizo" is the command-line utility based on the library.

Datizo performs calendrical calculations.
It doesn't use the "std.datetime" of Phobos or Tango from D.
